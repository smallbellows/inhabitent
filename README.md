# Inhabitent Custom WordPress Theme

Project 04 for RED Academy Front-End Web Development Professional Program

## Project Description

A custom WordPress theme for an imaginary camping store. The site includes custom post types ('products' and 'adventures') and a custom taxonomy ('product type'). There are two custom widgets to allow client to set business hours and contact information.  Finally, it includes a custom page template for the 'about' page, allowing content authors to upload a hero image for that page that will display as a background image.

## Tools Used

* WordPress
  * Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies
  * Custom Field Suite Plugin
  * A fully customized theme based on [underscores](https://github.com/automattic/_s)
* SASS / CSS3
* PHP
* jQuery
* Gulp
* VVV

## Reflections

Before this project, I had used WordPress on several sites and was familiar with how it could be used as a CMS. I didn't think it would be this approachable to create a fully customized theme, but thanks to the RED Starter Theme (a fork of underscores), there was a solid framework for my own PHP and CSS.

I am especially proud of being able to effectively manage the many files of this program, and keeping track of what styles to put into the various SASS partials. Staying organized was definitely key in this project.

The requirements for this project didn't include a mobile/responsive theme, but I hope to refactor this theme to include that important functionality.
